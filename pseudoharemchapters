	"description": "Eiji Kitahama, a second year high school student, just wants to be popular. To help him realize this dream, Rin Nanakura, his junior in the drama club, uses her acting skills to create a harem of loving girls for him. Though the various \"girls\" all show fondness toward Eiji, the affection of the actress behind them is very real. Rin's colorful acting continuously delights Eiji, but will the starlet herself ever make her way into his heart?\n\nThis is a collection of the colored Pseudo Harem chapters by u/mattyelo. As of right now there is no established release schedule but I am aiming for 1-3 chapters per week.",
